My Son Sanctuary and Marble Mountain are a short day trip from Hoi An and Hue is accessible by tour, bus or train.The nearest large city, Danang, is about 45 minutes away and is another beach-side tourist draw, popular with family holiday-makers"}, {"section": "Destinations in Vietnam", "subsection": "Hanoi", "info": "\u201d You haven\u2019t experienced Vietnam until you\u2019ve visited its noisy, vibrant capital city, Hanoi.

The people of Sapa started welcoming tourists as far back as the early 1900s, when French colonists used it to escape the searing heat of Vietnam\u2019s lowlands. During the 1940s, Vietnamese independence fighters drove the French from the region and it wasn\u2019t until a few decades ago that tourists started to return to Sapa.Within easy reach of Hanoi, by overnight bus or train, Sapa is now one of Vietnam\u2019s most popular tourist destinations.In Sapa, the magnificent purple mountains sink away into deep valleys, where terraced rice paddies feed the imagination \u2014 and the local population. Many ethnic minorities, including the H\u2019Mong, the Dao and the Dai, make their homes in small hidden villages among these hills. Be mindful of travelling ethically in Vietnam and in this delicate region.For tourists, the big draw is the chance to trek along Sapa\u2019s stunning valleys and mountains. It makes an excellent antidote to the hectic pace of life in Hanoi and is still a great place to escape the heat. Taking a multi-day trek between village homestays will give you the chance to immerse yourself in a slower pace of life, stretch your legs on the mountain tracks, and indulge in shots of the locally-made rice wine. It burns a little as it goes down but is perfect way to loosen your muscles after a long day of walking!\u201d"}, {"section": "Tours in Vietnam", "subsection": "", "info": "How do you want to visit Vietnam?

Kids really aren\u2019t a problem when you travel but we parents do worry about sickness, road safety and so on.So Vietnam with kids, what can I say? There are loads of interesting things for them to do like the pottery classes above, the Cu Chi tunnels tour or coconut boat rides and crab catching. There is much to learn about culture and history and Vietnamese food is generally lacking in spice or chili. You can also get just about any western food here, far more easily than in Thailand.Nobody in my family has had any sort of tummy trouble or diarrhoea in Vietnam but if you\u2019re not used to tropical bugs you may want to read our post on how to avoid mosquitoes.There are plenty of accommodation options at all price points and likewise plenty of transportation options. There are beaches if that is your want. It\u2019s as easy to take your kids to Vietnam as to any other country but be mindful of the weather and if you plan to use bikes bring your own helmets.I think I\u2019ve seen more tourists with kids, babies and toddlers in Hoi An than I have in any other Asian destination, it\u2019s a massively popular family holiday hot spot particularly for Australians.

You can\u2019t just turn up at the borders empty-handed and expect a visa on arrival unless you\u2019re on a two-week holiday. Vietnam requires a little forward planning for long-term travellers.\u00a0 Please read the information below and do your own research for your country. We\u2019re as current as we can be, but for Vietnam the regulations seem to change by the hour. You\u2019ll find a search box below ( an affiliate) for what we think is a trustworthy visa company.Visitors to Vietnam can visit a Vietnamese embassy to buy their Visa, or arrange an e-visa approval online which they must then produce on arrival. We were all set to visit the Vietnamese embassy in London when we discovered that using a visa agency was actually cheaper and potentially easier. The embassy in London would charge $100 US for each 3 month visa. That was significantly more expensive than using the agency. We took the agency route ( letter of pre-approval) for our 3 month Vietnam visa and had no problems whatsoever on arrival in Vietnam as UK passport holders.The agencies don\u2019t actually issue the visas but give you an authorization letter from the Vietnamese immigration department which allows you to receive a visa on arrival. Airlines are strict and won\u2019t let you on the plane without either a full visa or authorization letter, ours was checked at Heathrow. You pay a small fee to the agency to get the letter emailed to you. The agency will apply for multiple travellers so when you get your letter don\u2019t be surprised that it contains other people\u2019s details such as name, date of birth and passport number. You can ask for a private letter with just your details for approximately $10 US more per person.The costs are normally between $20 and $25 US for the authorization letter. You then need to pay the stamping fee on arrival in Vietnam where the actual visa is stuck into your passport. This ranges from $20 for a single month to $25 for a three-month single entry visa. The multiple entry visas attract a higher stamping fee approximately $50 US. All the stamping fees need to be paid in cash in US $.The authorization letter only works if you are flying into an international airport. It will not work at land crossings. For that you\u2019ll need to have a visa in your passport from an embassy or you will only be entitled to the free 15 day visa on arrival ( certain counties only)We\u2019ve consulted with the visa company below ( Sherpa, they are based in Canada) and they had the following to say:Americans\u2019 visa regulations for Vietnam are different again.

Don\u2019t expect a menu, these stalls specialise in one perfectly executed dish only be that mi quang, banh xeo or bun bo Hue.Vietnamese food isn\u2019t challenging to western palates, it\u2019s light and fresh with few spices.
