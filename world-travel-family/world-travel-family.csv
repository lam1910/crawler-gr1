Sleeping on a Junk Boat, while doing day visits to floating villages, taking rowing tours, and getting to jump off the boat into the cool refreshing water, is so relaxing and fun plus gives you a great insight to local living and seeing nature’s beauty up close. Highly recommend you choose your junk boat tour wisely and spend a few extra dollars to get a better experience and higher quality boat. We have done three tours since 2008 and loved Signature Cruises."
9,Destinations in Vietnam,Sapa,"Sapa is a must-see destination for nature lovers. Sapa is within easy reach of Hanoi, by overnight bus or train. In Sapa, the magnificent purple mountains sink away into deep valleys, where terraced rice paddies feed the imagination. Its has many ethnic minorities, including the H’Mong, the Dao and the Dai. The big draw is the chance to trek along Sapa’s stunning valleys and mountains. Taking a multi-day trek between village homestays will give you the chance to immerse yourself in a slower pace of life, stretch your legs, and indulge in shots of the locally-made rice wine which burns a little as it goes down but is perfect way to loosen your muscles after a long day of walking!"

19,Visas for Vietnam,Visas,"Visitors to Vietnam can visit a Vietnamese embassy to buy their Visa, or arrange an e-visa approval online which they must then produce on arrival. The embassy in London would charge $100 US for each 3 month visa. That was significantly more expensive than using the agency."
20,Visas for Vietnam,Travel Agency,"The agencies don’t actually issue the visas but give you an authorization letter from the Vietnamese immigration department which allows you to receive a visa on arrival. Airlines are strict and won’t let you on the plane without either a full visa or authorization letter. You pay a small fee to the agency to get the letter emailed to you but risk of getting wrong mail contains other people’s details such as name, date of birth and passport number as agency will apply for multiple travellers. The costs are normally between $20 and $25 US for the authorization letter. You then need to pay the stamping fee (from $20 for a single month to $25 for a three-month single entry visa) on arrival in Vietnam where the actual visa is stuck into your passport. The multiple entry visas attract a higher stamping fee approximately $50 US. All the stamping fees need to be paid in cash in US $.The authorization letter only works if you are flying into an international airport. It will not work at land crossings. For that you’ll need to have a visa in your passport from an embassy or you will only be entitled to the free 15 day visa on arrival (certain counties only)."

Do not expect a menu, these stalls specialise in one perfectly executed dish only. Vietnamese food is light and fresh with few spices. If you like your food hot you’ll find fresh and dried chilies on the table to add to taste. There are restaurants catering to tourists at every price point. Fresh, steamed and fried spring rolls are a favourite. You’ll find incredible fresh seafood in Central Vietnam with prawns costing little. Vegetarians, even vegans, are pretty well catered for in Vietnam too."
22,Vaccinations for Vietnam and Health,,"I’m happy to say that Vietnam is in the group that gave us zero ilnesses or tummy trouble. None of us have had any travellers diarrhoea or sickness in over 6 months in Vietnam. We’ve eaten everything, at every street food stall and had no trouble at all. We’re hugely impressed with how clean things are here compared to some other parts of the world. There are few flies, and few mosquitos, there are plenty of rats. If you get sick in Vietnam it’s easy to pop along to a pharmacy, there’s one on almost every street and the pharmacists are very helpful and know their stuff. We’ve had to buy treatment for ringworm ( picked up by one of the kids in London), mouth ulcers and dressings for bike-related scrapes, it’s been no trouble at all. I would suggest carrying a basic first aid kit with you. Beware of malaria in the rainy season."
